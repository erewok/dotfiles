# Dotfiles for My Working Environment

This is a repo for keeping track of configuration files for my development environments.

Following are some notes I have written for myself to remember how to set everything up.

## OSX

### Shell Stuff ###

- Update XCode (Wait for ten days for it complete).
- Install homebrew.
- Install git
- Install zshell
- Install anaconda for Python 3.6
- Install stack
- Install nvm

### Editor Stuff ###

- Install emacs >= 25
- Install atom editor
