# Dotfiles for My Working Environment

This is a repo for keeping track of configuration files for my development environments.

Following are some notes I have written for myself to remember how to set everything up.

## OSX

### Shell Stuff ###

- Update XCode (Wait for ten days for it complete).
- Install git
- Install homebrew
- Install htop (`brew install htop`)
- Install jq (json viewer: `brew install jq`)
- Install nvm
- Install zshell
- Install anaconda for Python 3.6
- Install Zulu Azul Java 8
- Install stack
- Install rustup
- Install ripgrep
- Install Docker for Mac

### Zshell

Zshell installation:

```
brew install zsh zsh-completions
```

[Pure theme](https://github.com/Zearin/zsh-pure)

[Tomorrow Night Eighties Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme)

Import the theme directly into OSX terminal.


### Editor Stuff ###

- Install emacs >= 25
- Install atom editor (depending on how much memory we have to waste...)
